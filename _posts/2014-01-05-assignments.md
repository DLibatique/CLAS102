## Writing / Creative Assignments

You will have two major assignments, each worth 15% of your final grade, as part of this course. The first is a compulsory argumentative essay, based on prompts that I will provide or on a topic of your choosing (that you've cleared with me first). The second is either a second argumentative essay or a more creative project.
