## Detailed Schedule
All assignments listed below are to be completed by the date under which they're listed. So, for example, you should come to class on Tuesday, 9/4, having read all of Plautus' *Casina*.

The parenthesis after each reading assignment is the source in which you can find the reading. "Hackett" means entry 1 in the texts section above (Francese and Smith, eds., *Ancient Rome: An Anthology of Sources*, Hackett 2014). The other four texts will be referenced by the author's last name. Some reading assignments will be found online -- a link will be provided.

I highly recommend that you complete the reading for both class meetings during the weekend prior; at the very least, make some decent headway into any given Thursday assignment before the interval between Tuesday and Thursday meetings. Some of the Thursday readings are long; you may not finish reading and internalizing them if you cram the reading into the space of a day.
